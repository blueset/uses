          For most code editing and text editing tasks. It can handle almost everything that I need to do with code and other plain text files.

          The multi-cursor support has been really helpful for repetitive edits. I also use it to do some temporary Python scripting with its built-in Jupyter notebook tabs.

          Other front-end development is still done using Visual Studio Code.

          So I decided to buy a MX Master 3, which was the latest model available at that time.

          I had been planning to upgrade it for quite a while since my 2 XL battery has been degrading rather fast.

          I bought this in Canada, and it wasn’t accepted well with some carriers in the US when I moved over. 
          I guess that’s has to be just a US thing. I have never encountered such issue in other countries.

          I would definitely wait for the next generation if I could. It was pretty sad to see the phone you bought dropped in price in just a month.

          It was my first phone with a stylus, and actually the last one.

          It was bought from a local mobile retailer under a now rather suspecious contract where we paid the retailer a considerable amount of money
          to get the device “for free” with their promise to return the money after 2 years.
          However, the retailer went out of business before the 2 years were up, and we never got the money back.

          Surprisingly the phone has lasted much longer than expected. It was mostly usable throughout the time with its battery replaced twice.
          I replaced it with a Nexus 6P when its performance started to fall behind.

          I traded in my old Pixel Watch 2 to get this new one, 
          mainly because Pixel Watch 2 only has a 41mm option, and I feel like it’s too small.

          I wrote [Simple Memo](https://1a23.com/works/open-source/simple-memo/) for Android Wear OS.

          My first smart watch. Solid in battery life and features. I really liked the rotating bezel.
          Contactless payment is locked to the purchasing country, but somewhat hackable.
          This was also purchased when I graduated to with GST return.

          I should have traded it in before it was too late.

          music control and notifications in the global edition.
